            <h1>1. Remember that everyone is more or less socially anxious<h1>
                <p>Bear in mind that social anxiety is built in peopleâ€™s nature. Of course some of us suffer from it less and others more but deep inside everyone is at least a bit anxious when meeting new people. Remembering this will prevent you from thinking that you are the only one that is socially anxious and hence will prevent you from feeling insecure and worse than others.

            <h1>2. Gain control over your mind<h1>
                <p>Believe it or not, you have a lot more control over your social anxiety than you think. Everything you feel emotionally happens in your head. So, if you will say to yourself that you are a very confident, outgoing person, there is a pretty high chance you will eventually become one. Just fake it till you make it :)

            <h1>3. Do not treat people you have met for the first time as strangers<h1>
                <p>I know it sounds like a weird advice but let me ask you a question: do you feel more at ease around people that you already know very well than with people you have just encountered for the first time? I suppose you said yes unless you are in 1% of people who would say no. So my piece of advice for you is to just think of everyone from your dorm as they were your good friends. This way, you will not only feel less stressed, but also make new friends in a natural way.
